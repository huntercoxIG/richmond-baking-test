Over the next twelve years, Greg's career in the dairy business offered him opportunities to gain invaluable experience in greenfield start-up, facility expansions, new product launches, contract manufacturing, business development, and supply chain management.  In addition to his practical experience, Greg holds an MBA with emphasis on Organizational Leadership.   Throughout his career, Greg has held a variety of leadership roles from production supervisor to, most recently, president.</p>

                    <p>Today as Vice President, Jerry prides himself on always being available for conversations and support regarding new product innovations and current product modifications.  His number one goal in business is to meet or exceed customer expectations-to assist customers in growing their businesses and pleasing their customers.</p>
                    <p>Jerry appreciates that Richmond Baking is flexible and well-tuned to the baking industry.  "The company is willing to reinvest to grow the business and be successful.  We are a business that sees changes in the industry and reacts to them accordingly. A business that truly understands the value of its customers and its employees," he says.</p>
