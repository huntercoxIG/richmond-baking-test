                <span>Chairman of the Board</span>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>James Quigg is the third generation of the Quigg family to head up Richmond Baking. He was President of the company for almost 35 years before "handing over the apron" to his son Bill. Today, Jim serves as the Chairman of the Board at Richmond Baking, functioning in an advisory capacity. "When I come into my office, I make sure the cookies aren't burning. If I don't smell
                        anything, I know everything is going smoothly," jokes Jim.</p>

                    <p>Jim received his Bachelor's degree from Miami University in Oxford, OH, and went on to earn a law degree from Indiana University. After passing the Indiana Bar Exam, Jim put his knowledge of business law to good use by joining the family company, Richmond Baking. "I handled insurance; labor and negotiations; and a potpourri of things relating to operation of the company,"
                        says Jim.</p>

                    <p>In 1969, Jim took over as President upon his father's death. Jim's leadership was influential in making large-scale changes at the company. He authorized on-site storage and warehousing modifications, expanded the company's product lines and negotiated a country-wide expansion with the opening of new plants in Georgia and Oregon.</p>

                    <p>Jim comes from a long line of Quakers and believes that many of his beliefs have added to Richmond Baking's success. "Historically, the Quakers have conducted business with handshakes. I've tried to hold over some of these principles of integrity in our business. I believe one of the reasons Richmond Baking has around for so long is that we treat our customers fairly and
                        keep our standards the highest levels."</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>Bill takes pride in the fact that Richmond Baking is a family-owned business steeped in the historic tradition of its community, Richmond, IN. He volunteers his time serving as a Governing Board Member and Audit Committee Chairman of Reid Hospital & Health Care Services.</p>

                    <p>Bill is also involved in associations that serve the biscuit and cracker industry. Bill served as a President of the Cookie & Snack Baker's Association (CASBA) and is the current 2nd Vice Chairman and Treasurer of the Biscuit and Cracker Manufacturer's Association (B&CMA). "I deeply value the relationships that I have been fortunate enough to establish in the industry, I
                        have gained great friendships and those connections have positively impacted Richmond Baking."</p>

                    <p>"At Richmond Baking, we have the flexibility to make decisions quickly and to create true partnerships with our customers. Our size is large enough to provide cost effective solutions and run efficient operations, while remaining small enough to be flexible for unique customer needs."</p>

                    <p>Bill Quigg, President of Richmond Baking, takes extra strides to create a community at Richmond Baking - spending time with coworkers and learning about their families, hobbies and community interests. "Our goal is to create Raving Fans of our employees, as well as our customers. In fact, we believe that in order to truly have Raving Fan customers; we have to start with our
                        employees."We don't want a customer that is merely satisfied with our company. We want people that love to do business with us. Every day, we strive to exceed our customers' expectations and create Raving Fans," says Bill.</p>

                    <p>Bill started working in the company bakeries at the age of 12. When he was old enough to work around the industrial machines, Bill went to work in the mixing and sanitation areas of the Richmond plant and worked his way through all aspects of the family business. A Richmond native, Bill graduated from Richmond High School. He earned a Bachelor's degree in Human Resources
                        from Miami University in Oxford, OH. While working full-time at the Richmond Baking, Bill went on to earn his Master's in Business Administration, also from Miami University.</p>

                    <p>In 2002, at Richmond Baking's centennial celebration, Bill's father, Jim, "passed the apron" to Bill, appointing him as the next President of the company. Although Bill's professional focus is in Operations and Sales, his overriding commitment is to creating Raving Fan Customers.</p>
